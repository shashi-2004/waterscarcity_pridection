# waterscarcity_pridection
This project uses a Random Forest Regressor model to predict water scarcity for cities. It considers factors like rainfall, population, demand, reservoir levels, groundwater usage, and temperature to provide future predictions. The model is trained on historical data and uses a specific formula to calculate the scarcity percentage.
